		<h2>Games</h2>
		<p>Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.</p>
		<h2>Indoor vs Outdoor</h2>
		<p>Indoor games are those games which are played in a room by sitting there and in open. games like chess, carom, playing cards, ludo, table tennis etc. outdoor games are those games which are played in a large area or in grounds. like cricket, football, hockey, horse riding etc..So this proves that outdoor games are better because they are not a waste of time and they have more advantages than indoor games.</p><br>
